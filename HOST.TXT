The enclosed files make the interface to OS/2 Communications Manager in Microsoft C much easier.  The routines have been used with OS/2 EE 1.3 with no problems.

The files should be used as follows:

HOST.OBJ and HOST.DEF must be included in the make file definition for your program.

HOST.H must be included in you C source file.

HOST.C is provided so the workbench may recompile it for use in different models.  It should be in the same directory as HOST.OBJ.



A couple examples follow:

#include <stdio.h>
#include "HOST.H"
void main( void )
{
    if( host( HostConnect, "A" ))
    {
        printf( "Can not connect to session A" );
        return( 1 );
    }
    if( host( SearchHost, "Logon ID:" ))
    {
        printf( "Host is not ready to receive an ID" );
        return( 2 );
    }
    host( SendKeyToHost, "MyLognID@E" );
    host( WaitForHost, "" );
    if( host( SearchHost, "Password:" ))
    {
        printf( "Host did not ask for password" );
        return( 3 );
    }
...

The above program segment (1) connects to host session "A", (2) looks for a message asking for a logon ID, (3) sends the string "MyLogonID" followed by an enter, (4) waits for the host to unlock the keyboard, (5) checks for a message asking for a password.



#include "HOST.H"
void main( void )
{
    int funcnum,
        infolen,
        errorcode;
    char infostr[80];

    if( host( HostConnect, "A" ))
    {
        printf( "Can not connect to session A" );
        return( 1 );
    }
    host( HostDisconnect, "A" );
    funcnum = ReceiveFile;
    errorcode = 1;
    infostr = "a:report.dat A:REPORT SCRIPT A (CRLF ASCII"
    infolen = 42;
    hllapi( &funcnum, infostr, &infolen, &errorcode );
...

The above program segment (1) connects to host session "A", (2) disconnects after checking for errors, (3) sets the variables to download a file with errorcode telling HLLAPI to look on drive A: for the receive command infostr telling HLLAPI to get a file from session A called REPORT SCRIPT A on the host and put in on drive a: as report.dat.  See the Communications Manager manual for more details on the receive command syntax.  The errorcode variable could be checked next to verify the file transfer worked...
